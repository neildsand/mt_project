Introduction:  >
  Throughout the term, we explored the dataset investigated by Gardner, Zanic, and coworkers.  Our goal was to investigate the dynamics of microtubule catastrophe, and more specifically, to gain insights around the time between the start of of growth for a microtubule to the catastrophe event.  Our analysis was centered around three main pieces.  First, we had to test the experimentally procedure.  Second, we developed a generative model for the time to catastrophe of the microtubules.  Finally, we explore the relationship between tubulin concentration and time to catastrophe.
  
Analysis of Experimental Procedure:  >
  In order to monitor microtubules, Garner, Zanic, et al. labeled tubulin with a fluorescent marker.  Because we are interested in the time to microtubule catastrophe, it is important to ensure that fluorescent labels and exposure to laser light did not affect the microtubule dynamics which would compromise the results.  As such, Garner, Zanic, et al. performed an experiment using DIC microscopy in order to measure time to catastrophe for labeled and unlabeled tubulin.  Figure 1 demonstrates an ECDF with confidence intervals of this data.  From this inital ECDF, we already hypothesize that the labeled and unlabeled tubulin are distributed identically, meaning that the fluorescence is not affected the time to microtubule catastrophe, meaning the experimental procedure is sound.  In order to support this hypothesis, we used non-parametric inference in order to compute confidence intervals for the plug-in estimate for the mean time to catastrophe for each tubulin type.  Figure 2 displays these confidence intervals.  The overlap present provides additional support to our hypothesis.  Finally, we perform a null-hypothesis test under the null hypothesis that the distribution of microtubule catastrophe times with labeled tubulin is the same as unlabeled tubulin.  We use the difference of means as our test statistic, and compute a p-value of 0.77.  From the combination of all this analysis, we conclude that the labeled and unlabeled tubulin follow the same distribution and therefore we can accept the experimental procedure of fluorescent labeling.
  
Analysis of Generative Model for Time to Catastrophe:  >
  
  Our next goal is to develop the generative model for microtubule time to catastrophe, for which we consider two possible models.  We will consider the model assumed by Garner, Zanic, et al., that the microtubule catastrophe times are Gamma Distributed.  Second, we will assert that two biochemical processes happen in succession to trigger catastrophe, where each of them is a Poisson process. This will be reffered to as the Poisson Model.  
  
  Gamma distribution is well defined, we know the PDF is ...
  
  In order to assess the two models, we want to understand how well matched the proposed generative model is to the actual generative model, which is unknown.  What we do know however, is what data the actual generative model generates, so we will compare data generated by our generative models to the actual data.  We formulate this through predictive ECDFs, and the difference between the predictive ECDF's and the data's ECDF.  This is demonstrated in Figure x.  We see that...

  Our final piece of analysis investigates the microtubule catastrophe under different concentrations of tubulin.
